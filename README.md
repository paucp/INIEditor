# INIEditor
 INI File editor software.
 On this early version only support INI files in the following format: 
 ```
 [GroupName1]
 KeyName1=Value1
 KeyName2=Value2
 [GroupName1]
 KeyName3=Value3
 ```
Empty lines and foward whitespaces are ignored, any comments or format differences will cause the program not to work as intended.

Future updates will include:
```
+ Comment support
+ Search by key name, and key value
+ Group editing and deleting
+ Support for creating INI files from scratch
+ Highligthing of added/edited/removed keys (green, yellow, red)
+ Better UI feedback (messageboxes on save, warnings on closing etc)
